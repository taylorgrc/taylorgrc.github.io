        <h1> Caslon vs. Baskerville </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Caslon</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Caslon is an old style serif typeface that was designed in 1722 by William Caslon I, an English type designer who first began creating fonts in the early 1700s. Influenced by Dutch type, a style that was popular in England at the time, Caslon is characterized by its clean lines, strong serifs, and elegant proportions, which is why it is highly legible and popular for book printing. It has been widely used in printing, advertising, and publishing since its creation, including in the type for the American Declaration of Independence and Constitution. It was eventually redesigned to adapt to the needs of hot metal typesetting, phototypesetting, and eventually digital typesetting. All these typefaces are called “Caslon,” but have some variation from each individual designer and for the specific requirements for each method of typesetting. Carol Twombly designed the “Caslon” used by Adobe for digital typesetting in 1990, optimizing the typeface for both digital design and print, as well as adding additional glyphs and characters like small caps, swash caps, ligatures, etc. </p>
             
			 <h3>Baskerville</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>The Baskerville typeface was designed in 1757 in Birmingham, England by John Baskerville, with the intent of improving Caslon in legibility and readability in industrial book printing. At the time of its creation, many thought that it was too different from old style typefaces, and it was not widely used until 1917. Nowadays it is used for academic publications and in the branding of many “homestyle” brands, as it is known for its clean lines, elegant appearance, and timeless appeal. It is considered a transitional typeface, meaning it bridges the typical styles of old style and modern typefaces. Compared to Caslon, Baskerville has more contrast between thick and thin strokes, sharper and more tapered serifs, more vertical stress. These changes were influenced by the calligraphy Baskerville had learned when he was younger.  </p>
